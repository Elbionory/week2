            " Before joining the bootcamp,I've never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wornderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.They
            were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for asistance. The
            agile team project in particular, was outstanding . it look my
            learning to the next fact , I've often referred to it during
            interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
            helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
            multiple offers. 100% recommended! "
